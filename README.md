Here I develop an AI system that authenticates users based on their unique mouse movement patterns (e.g., speed, acceleration, click patterns).
# Behavioral Biometrics for User Authentication

## Overview
I aim to develop a user authentication system based on unique mouse movement patterns, such as speed, acceleration, click timing, and trajectory. This system can be used for:

- **Secondary authentication** in secure systems
- **Fraud detection**
- **Continuous authentication** during a session

## Features
- 🚀 **Real-time Mouse Data Collection**: I capture mouse coordinates, click events, scroll patterns, and movement speed.
- 🛠 **Data Preprocessing**: I normalize and clean data to remove noise and handle screen resolution differences.
- 📊 **Feature Extraction**: I analyze behavioral, spatial, temporal, and statistical features from the mouse data.
- 🤖 **Machine Learning Model**: I train models (Random Forest, SVM, Neural Networks, or Deep Learning approaches) for user authentication.
- 🔒 **Authentication Module**: I authenticate users based on real-time mouse movement patterns.
- 📟 **Optional User Interface**: I provide a dashboard for monitoring authentication logs and user settings.

## 🏗 System Architecture
### 1️⃣ Data Collection Module
- Please refer to syedausafhaider/mouse_tracker_chrome_extension
- I have created a chrome extension that is allowed in developer mode to capture real time movement of cursor and acts a a data collection module.
- I capture real-time mouse movements using JavaScript (for browsers) or PyAutoGUI (for desktop applications).
- I store data in structured formats (CSV or database).

### 2️⃣ Preprocessing Module
- I clean and normalize raw mouse data.
- I segment data into meaningful chunks (per session or task).

### 3️⃣ Feature Extraction Module
- I extract key features such as movement trajectory, click behavior, and statistical metrics.

### 4️⃣ Machine Learning Model
- I train supervised, unsupervised, or deep learning models to authenticate users.

### 5️⃣ Authentication Module
- I perform real-time authentication based on mouse movement patterns.
- I ensure security with threshold-based decision-making.

### 6️⃣ User Interface (Optional)
- I provide a web-based dashboard for monitoring authentication logs.

## ⚙️ Installation
### 📌 Prerequisites
- 🐍 Python 3.x
- 🌐 Node.js (for frontend integration)
- 📦 Required Python libraries: `numpy`, `pandas`, `scikit-learn`, `tensorflow`, `flask` (or `django`)
- 📦 Required JavaScript libraries: `express`, `socket.io`

### 🔧 Setup
#### 📥 Clone the repository
```sh
git clone https://github.com/syedausafhaider/Behavioral_Biometrics_for_User_Authentication_using_mouse_scroll.git
cd mouse-authentication
```

#### 🖥 Backend Setup (Python)
```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
python app.py
```

#### 🌍 Frontend Setup (JavaScript)
```sh
cd frontend
npm install
npm start
```

## 🚀 Usage
- I run the backend and frontend servers.
- The system collects mouse movement data and authenticates users based on trained models.
- I use the dashboard to view logs and adjust authentication settings.

## 🔒 Security Considerations
- 🛡 **Data Privacy**: I ensure compliance with GDPR and other regulations.
- 🔍 **Spoofing Resistance**: I use advanced features to detect imitation attacks.
- 🔐 **Encryption**: I store sensitive data securely.

## 🔮 Future Enhancements
- 🏆 **Multi-Modal Biometrics**: I plan to combine mouse dynamics with keystroke patterns.
- 🔄 **Continuous Authentication**: I will implement ongoing monitoring throughout a session.
- 🧠 **Adaptive Learning**: I aim to update user profiles dynamically.
